# Deep Learning With X-Plane Issue Tracker and Feature Requests

See the [issue list](https://github.com/conor103/DL_with_XPlane/issues) for a list of all issues. **Please check this list before submitting a new issue**. There are [filters](https://github.com/conor103/DL_with_XPlane/labels) you can use in order to sort by issues or contributions.

** Submitting an issue
1. In the title, be short and concise that identifies the issue. Include the specific lesson or relevant instructional material. For example, "L1 Slides incorrect definition"
2. In the main body, 1) describe the error as you see it and 2) the suggested solution. If the issue is about any of the jupyter notebooks, datasets, or python scripts, please include any system information that may be helpful for debugging like:
    * Where you were running the script (terminal, anaconda, jupyterlab, Google Colab, etc.)
    * Any error messages that came up when running the code
    * How we could reproduce your error (sample code, required packages/datasets, etc.)
    * Any workarounds you've discovered
3. Include any relevant screenshots or images.
4. Appropriately tag your post with a relevant label. You can use more than one, but try not to use more than 2.

** Submitting an enhancement
1. In the title, choose a short but descriptive title for your suggestion. For example, "Scaffold teaching python"
2. In the main body, go into more detail about what your contribution is. Be sure to include
    * What issue prompts the need for your contribution? How does it add to student learning or instructional practices?
    * Which lesson(s) is it most relevant to, and, if it's more lessons, where would it be placed in the sequence?
    * If it's a contribution, are there any copywrite notices to be aware of
    * If it's a request, what are the goals of your request, and outline how those could be achieved.
3. Appropriately tag your post with the relevant label. Try not to use more than 2 labels. If you are contributing a resource, please make sure that your resource is not violating copywrite or privacy rules, that your resource is at least viewable to the public, and that you use the `contribution` label.
